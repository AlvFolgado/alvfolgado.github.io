I am a Security Engineer focused in Offensive Security. I will use this blog to comment about my last researches. Mainly as a learning process for myself and to share with the community.

Everyone is invited to comment and correct my technical mistakes since it will be tons of them (as much as grammar ones :p).

Thank everyone to take the time to reach the blog and read the content.

Love,cats,rebujito and Hack the planet!
